iRail supports digital creativity concerning mobility in Belgium. This is an attempt to make the railway time schedules in Belgium easily available for anyone.

Our main site consists of a very easy mobile website to look up time schedules using our own API.

Native applications using the iRail API and created or supported by the iRail team are named BeTrains and RailerApp.

All information can be found on [our blog at hello.iRail.be](http://hello.irail.be/).

## Installation for development purposes ##

_note: you'll also need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org), [composer](http://getcomposer.org) and PHP curl extension installed on your system_

 * Step 1: Clone this repo
 * Step 2: `composer install`
 * Step 3: Make sure storage is writable: `chmod 777 storage`
 * Step 4: Run your test server: `php -S localhost:8008 -t api`
 * Step 5: Enjoy your own iRail API at http://localhost:8008/connections.php?from=Gent%20Sint%20Pieters&to=Antwerp

**Optional**, if you want to set up the iRail API with occupancy scores you will need to set up a MongoDB database:

 * Step 6: Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community)
 * Step 7: Install the MongoDB module for PHP: `pecl install mongodb`
 * Step 8: Include MongoDB: `composer require mongodb/mongodb:^1.0` (make sure to not commit the composer.json file)
 * Step 9: Add MongoDB environment variables: `cp .env.example .env` (If your MongoDB URL is different or you want another database name you can change this file)
 * Step 10: Import the data (the structural.csv file) in MongoDB: `mongoimport -d irail -c structural --type csv --file occupancy/data/structural.csv --headerline`
 * Step 11: Run the startscript to push structural data to the occupancy table: `php occupancy/scripts/startscript.php`
 * Step 12: Once the startscript has ran, the task of pushing strutural data to the occupancy table should be automated: `crontab -e` => `30 3 * * * php $PATH_TO_IRAIL_FOLDER/occupancy/scripts/cronjob.php`
 * Step 13: Enjoy the occupancy scores in all the GET requests and the POST request: `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"connection": "http://irail.be/connections/8871308/20160722/IC4516","from": "http://irail.be/station/NMBS/008871308","date": "20160722","vehicle": "http://irail.be/vehicle/IC4516","occupancy":"http://api.irail.be/terms/medium","to":"http://irail.be/stations/NMBS/008872009"}' http://localhost:8008/feedback/occupancy.php`
