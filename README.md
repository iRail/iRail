iRail supports digital creativity concerning mobility in Belgium. This is an attempt to make the railway time schedules in Belgium easily available for anyone. 

Our main site consists of a very easy mobile website to look up time schedules using our own API.

Native applications using the iRail API and created or supported by the iRail team are named BeTrains and RailerApp.

All information can be found on [our blog at hello.iRail.be](http://hello.irail.be/).

## Installation for development purposes ##

_note: you'll also need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org), [composer](http://getcomposer.org) and PHP curl extension installed on your system_

 * Step 1: clone this repo
 * Step 2: `composer install`
 * Step 3: make sure storage is writable: `chmod 777 storage`
 * Step 4: Run your test server: `php -S localhost:8008 -t api`
 * Step 5: Enjoy your own iRail API at http://localhost:8008/connections.php?from=Gent%20Sint%20Pieters&to=Antwerp

## Update stations list ##

Stations are updated through the irail/stations composer package. Just perform a `composer update` in the root of the project

## Set up the MongoDB yourself ##

Things you will need on the server you want to set it up:

 * MongoDB
  * Installation on the [MongoDB site](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community)
 * PHP 7.0
 * MongoDB module for PHP
  * Preferable with PECL `sudo pecl install mongodb`
  * In case of problems with `Homebrew brew install php70-mongodb`

If you got these things set up you will need to import the data (the .csv files) in MongoDB that already exists in the [Spitsgids-data repo](https://github.com/osoc16/Spitsgids-data):

```
mongoimport -d spitsgids -c survey --type csv --file survey.csv --headerline
mongoimport -d spitsgids -c nmbs --type csv --file nmbs.csv --headerline
```

If you run `mongod` now you should be good to go!
